This is a **frontend mockup of an AI image generation app**, built entirely with **HTML and CSS**.

The project simulates the structure and design of a platform where users can generate, view, and interact with AI-generated images. Although it doesn't include backend functionality or real AI integration, it provides a solid visual prototype.

## 💡 Purpose

I created this project for a friend who needed a visual model for a university assignment. It also gave me the opportunity to **refresh and practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills** in a creative context.
